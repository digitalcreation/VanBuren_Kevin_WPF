//How many monkeys does it take to screw in a light bulb
//Factors needed for their intelligence -
// 1) How often do the monkey's groom each other? (increase in intel)
// 2) How often do the monkey's fling their feces? (decrease in intel)
// 3) How many hours a day do the monkey's play games with each other? (increase in intel)
// 4) On a scale of 1 to 10, how aggressive are they? (decrease in intel)
